## Our Pledge
 
We, as contributors and maintainers of Adelheid, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

 We commit to fostering a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive environment â€” especially when dealing with disagreement. This project is about making discourse better, not more hostile.
 
## Our Standards
 
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
 
- Using inclusive and respectful language
- Actively listening and showing empathy
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Being mindful of the impact of your words
 
Examples of unacceptable behavior:
 
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission
- Dismissing othersâ€™ contributions or perspectives in a hostile tone
 
## Our Responsibilities
 
Maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
 
## Scope
