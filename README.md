# 🧠 Adelheid — Detecting Fallacies in Political Speech

**Adelheid** is an open-source project that detects **fallacies, manipulative rhetoric, and cognitive biases** in political discourse — live and in real-time.  
It empowers citizens, journalists, and educators with an AI-powered lens to decode the rhetorical tactics that shape our democracies.

> _"Named after Adelheid Schopenhauer, a silent observer of her brother’s philosophical dominance — this project reclaims voice, logic, and critique."_

## 🎯 What does Adelheid do?

Adelheid uses **OpenAI models (GPT-4, Whisper)** to detect:
- 🧱 Logical fallacies (e.g. ad hominem, slippery slope, strawman)
- 🎯 Persuasive strategies (framing, false dilemmas, appeals to authority)
- 🧠 Cognitive biases (anchoring, halo effect, conformity bias)
- 💬 Ideological drift and manipulation over time

Adelheid works in four phases:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1** | 📄 Text input (MVP): paste speech/debate text for fallacy detection |
| **2** | 🎙️ Live audio: real-time analysis of radio/podcast debates |
| **3** | 📺 Live video: transcription + fallacy overlay during live shows |
| **4** | 🐦 Social media tracking: real-time analysis of political discourse on X (formerly Twitter) |

## 🧬 Theoretical Backbone

Adelheid is grounded in:
- Computational argumentation (Serena Villata)
- Behavioral psychology (Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky)
- Persuasion science (Robert Cialdini)
- Social conformity studies (Solomon Asch, Leon Festinger)
- Cognitive bias theory (Herbert Simon, halo effect)

## 🚧 Project Status

🔬 Currently in **Phase 1**:  
- Prompt engineering for text-based fallacy detection  
- MVP Web prototype in progress  

Next up:  
- Integration of Whisper API  
- UX prototype for live stream annotation

## 🤖 Tech Stack

- GPT-4 & GPT-4 Turbo (via OpenAI API)
- Whisper for transcription
- Python + FastAPI (backend)
- React or SvelteKit (frontend)
- Optional: macOS + Android app builds for native streaming
